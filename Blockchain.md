# Blockchain

## What is it?
"A public, permanent, append-only distributed ledger."[[1]](https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/04/23/143477/explainer-what-is-a-blockchain/). The [Blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) is like a record, a ledger or spreadsheet containing information about transactions. It is a series of linked data blocks, nothing can be erased from it but new blocks can be added.

## Why should I care?
Blockchain has the potential to disrupt traditional financial institutions.

## Is it secure?
Immutability is theoretically possible, however, the decentralization nature of blockchain would require one to take control  of more than 51% of computers in the same distributed ledger and be able to alter records within a very short time. This is about 10 minutes for a platform like Bitcoin. This has yet to happen as of this writing.[[2]](https://blogs.adb.org/blog/how-secure-blockchain)

## Security Concepts in Blockchain
Hash Functions and Asymmetric cryptography are technologies used extensively in Blockchain.

## What are Hash Functions?
A function that maps an arbitrary size of data to a fixed-sized value.
## What is Asymmetric cryptography  ?
It is a type of cryptography that uses keys. All users get two keys:
* One public key
* One private key 

Users exchange their public keys to communicate with each other.
