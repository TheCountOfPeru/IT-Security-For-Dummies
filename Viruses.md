# Malware
There is no doubt that you aware of what viruses are if you've ever used a computer before. Likely you are aware of how dangerous they are to your computer, and they may be the first thing you blame once your computer starts to move slower than usual. Their creators probably living in a dark lair somewhere plotting how to extort innocent people. But there is a lot more depth to creating viruses than you likely are aware of, and the many different forms of viruses there are out there. Or the fact that viruses themselves fall under the larger branch of malicious software known as Malware, and the sheer variety of malware there is out there.

## How do they do it?
There are two keys ways for a piece of malware to infect your computer.
1. First, by you doing some action that allows it to be downloaded or executed. For example, you may view a webpage with malicious code, or insert a USB drive, or open some shady email attachment. Malware is infamous for social engineering and tricking people into downloading it. In a more recent example, a malware going by the very original name, COVID-19 Malware, involves a file called 'covid19.exe' which curious users may download, only to have their computer's master boot record altered and their device rendered un-startable.![1](https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/04/02/305b656b-d1b6-444e-a5f8-04677c740e79/resize/1200x900/9922c06e2328e860369860a7bc86c213/coronaimage.png)

1. Secondly, by exploiting some sort of flaw in existing software. This is something which you will have to worry less about, as long as you are keeping up with your updates, it is not really something you can do much about. Sometimes software just has flaws, and people find ways to break in.
